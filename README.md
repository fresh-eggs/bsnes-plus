# bsnes-plus

bsnes-plus (or bsnes+) is a fork of bsnes (based on bsnes-classic) intended to
introduce some new features and improvements, mostly aimed at debugging.

This fork of bsnes+ contains my ongoing work to add support for the [XBAND Modem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XBAND).


## What's new

- Improved debugger UI with register editing
- Redesigned memory editor and breakpoint editor
- Improved handling of address mirroring for breakpoints (extends to the entire address space, not just RAM)
- Real-time code and data highlighting in memory editor, with fast searching for known code/data locations and unexplored regions
- Cartridge ROM and RAM views in memory editor for mapper-agnostic analysis
- Enhanced VRAM, sprite, and tilemap viewing
- SA-1 disassembly and debugging
- SA-1 bus and BW-RAM viewing and (partial) usage logging
- Super FX disassembly and debugging
- Super FX bus viewing and usage logging

Non-debugging features:

- Satellaview / BS-X support
- SPC file dumping
- SPC output visualizer (keyboards & peak meters)
- IPS and BPS soft patching
- Multiple emulation improvements backported from bsnes/higan (mostly via bsnes-classic)

## Development builds

[![Build status](https://ci.appveyor.com/api/projects/status/2eatkcuu14r8rnfx/branch/master?svg=true)](https://ci.appveyor.com/project/devinacker/bsnes-plus/branch/master)

Up-to-date development builds are available [from AppVeyor](https://ci.appveyor.com/project/devinacker/bsnes-plus/branch/master/artifacts) (64-bit Windows, compatibility and accuracy profiles).

## Building on Windows

- [Get mingw-w64](http://mingw-w64.yaxm.org/doku.php/download) (make sure toolchain supports 64-bit builds)
- Initialize the bsnes-plus-ext-qt submodule in git
- Run `mingw32-make`

## Building on OS X

Currently, OS X is not officially 100% supported. See [this fork](https://github.com/Optiroc/bsnes-plus) for now.

## Building on Linux / other *nix

As there is no ``configure`` step, make sure necessary Qt5/X11 packages are installed. On a Debian/Ubuntu system, it would require a command like:

```
sudo apt install qt5-default qtbase5-dev-tools libxv-dev libsdl1.2-dev libao-dev libopenal-dev g++
```

Afterwards, run ``make`` and if everything works out correctly you will find the output binary in the ``out/`` directory.

The snesfilter, snesreader, and supergameboy plugins can all be built by running make (or mingw32-make) after you've configured your environment to build bsnes itself.
After building, just copy the .dll, .so, or .dylib files into the same directory as bsnes itself.
